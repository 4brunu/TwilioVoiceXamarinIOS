# Twilio Voice Xamarin IOS

Twilio Voice iOS SDK binding for Xamarin

```
NuGet package will be added soon!
```

## How to Build

### Twilio.Voice iOS 6.3.0 (May 17, 2021)
```
sh bootstrapper.sh
```

Add --registrar:static as additional mtouch arguments on iOS Build dialog for your iOS application
Sometimes adding --registrar:static -cxx -gcc_flags -dead_strip flags is required.

## Sample

####  We don't have C# version of twilio quickstart application, so I highly recommend you to read about using native library bindings for xamarin and check official Twilio quickstart guides.
